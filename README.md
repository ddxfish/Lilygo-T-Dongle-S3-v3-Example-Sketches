You must have TFT_eSPI already working on your screen for this.

### Barchart Basic
This displays multiple bars in a chart. Input between 1 and 8 numbers, and the TFT will calculate the width of the bars, spacing, and display the numbers you input. No labels or text at all.

### Image Basic
Simply displays an image on the TFT screen. Uses UTFT 565 format. You convert image to UTFT and edit the variable names to match.
